# 📘 Dataset Overview
This dataset was developed as part of a course project for [CSCI-GA 2565: Machine Learning](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring25/CSCI-GA.2565-001/) at NYU. Our objective was to build a training pipeline that enables LLMs to perform structured academic paper reviewing.

## 🛠 Data Collection & Preprocessing

- **Paper Content**:  
  Raw papers were collected from [OpenReview](https://openreview.net) using their official API. The PDFs were converted into Markdown format using [Nougat OCR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nougat), followed by a custom cleaning pipeline involving regular expressions to remove OCR artifacts, redundant symbols, and formatting inconsistencies.

- **Review Aggregation**:  
  OpenReview often includes multiple reviews per paper. We used multi-step prompting with GPT-4 to generate an **aggregated structured review**, consolidating multiple perspectives into a single coherent evaluation covering key points, strengths/weaknesses, and suggestions.

> ⚠️ **Note**: While the dataset quality is sufficient for research and experimentation, it may still contain noisy or imperfect samples due to the automated preprocessing and OCR limitations.
